How do I approach designing software?

  My first step when designing software is to completely understand the problem I am tasked with solving, and in doing so I am able to ensure that what I create is not only correct but also complete. I also iterate constantly, taking each element of the problem and trying solutions until the right one is found.


  This is one of my first times creating visualizations that were not data charts or so on, and one of the design skills I learned was the importance of texture. Accurate texture makes a scene appear more realistic, and the object within the scene very easy to identify.

  For this project I took one object at a time. For example, I would create the shape of the lava lamp, then added the material and texture each part of the lamp before moving on the say the stack of books. For me this allows me to stay focused on getting everything about the object right, instead of creating all of the shapes then doing all the materials and textures.

  I will definetly carry over the idea of tackling one oject or function at a time in other projects. For me I need to stay focused on one thing at a time, and doing that in this project was a big reason why I was able to complete it and in a non-stressful way. 


  
How do I approach developing programs?

  The best programs are the simplest, and every time I begin to develop a program that is always at the forefront of my mind. In this project I modulated my code and did my best to reuse elements such as material shaders for similar objects in order to make my code a simple as possible.  

  I did not do anything that was fundamentally different than what I normally do, but working with a visual product you have to consider certain things that you would not it other disciplines. For example, with visual product things like proportions and color are very important, where with data analytics these things do not matter, but the overall approach to both are similar. 

  Iteration is the key to my approach, especially as a kinetic learner, breaking down a problem into steps and then iterating solutions is the best way for me to code. It is best to prepare and understand the basics of how to approach a problem or else iteration can take a long time, but it is a necessary part of development. 

  Just like when iterating, breaking down a large project like this into different steps is a great way to make efficient progress. Coming from no experience in this feild, the final project seemed quite daunting, but breaking it down into steps from plane, to shape, to color and texture, to lighting and materials made the whole project move in a timely and easy manner. 


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

  Since I am planning on doing data analytics computer science will provide me the best tools to find patterns and trends inside the very large and complex data that exists today. This being my first real exposure to graphics and visual design I am very interested in learning more about it. I think learning more about making these scenes dynamic would give a lot of perspective to how talented game designers really are. While I don't know if I will exactly be using OpenGL in my career, the process and learning a new API and programming concept certainly will and that comfortability of learning something new will help set me apart in a very competitive career field.
